The goal of this project is to provide a very lightweight implementation of Storage Resource Management (SRM) interface for POSIX-compliant file systems that would be easy to maintain and deploy.

Tool command language (Tcl) is used for implementing high-level logic and for gluing together several technologies such as Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), HTTP, XML and SOAP.
