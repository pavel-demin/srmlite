#summary Binding to GSI via GSSAPI and Tcl_StackChannel API for Tcl

= Introduction =

This extension provides a binding to Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), utilizing the Globus GSSAPI and the new Tcl_StackChannel API for Tcl 8.2 and higher. The sockets behave exactly the same as channels created using Tcl's built-in socket command with additional options for controlling the GSI session.
